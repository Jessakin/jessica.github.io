				<p>My name is Jessica.</p>  
				<p>I'm a networking major that has been tinkering with electronics since I was 15.  My very first computer was an old laptop that was too weak to run Windows Vista, so I installed Linux and made some tweaks every couple of months to keep it running until I got my first desktop.</p>
				<p>It was an old Dell Optiplex that I modified and replace with parts I found in e-waste until it started working.  This helped me determine my major when I went into college for computer networking</p>
				<p>While I was in college, I partook in the Business Professionals of America association, and in 2022, I went to the national competition in Fort Werth, Texas.  
					While there, I took 1st place in Network Administration using Cisco and 2nd place in Web Design.  
					Then in 2023, I went to the national competition in Anaheim, California and took 2nd in Computer Networking, Top 5 in Network Administraiton using Cisco, and Top 5 in Visual Design Team.  
					I also passed the test for the Cisco Certified Support Technician which superceeded the CCENT.
					To finish my time in College, I graduated with an Associates of Applied Sciences in Information Technology with Dean's Honors.
				</p>
				<p>I then went into the work force, starting as tech support for Nex-Tech, an Internet Service Provider in Kansas.  It did not provide enough hours or money for me to survive, so I took an IT internship in Medora, North Dakota.
					One of the largest projects up there was switching over the networking hardware from Ubiquiti equipment to Cisco Meraki equipment.  The job was great, but medical issues resulted in my premature termination.
				</p>
				<p>In 2025, I returned back to school at Fort Hays State University, where I became a member of the Honor's College, took 18 College Credit hours, participated in the cybersecurity club, and worked as a journalist for the campus media network.</p>
